# Practice Mode Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Double-Click Issue âœ…

**Problem**: Users had to click twice to start a practice session and the first message wouldn't be processed.

**Root Cause**: A `st.rerun()` call in the message processing logic was interrupting the natural flow and causing the app to restart processing before completing the first message.

**Fix**: Removed the problematic `st.rerun()` call from line 457 in the message processing section of `_render_practice_mode_tab()`.

### 2. Infinite Loops Prevention âœ…

**Problem**: The `st.rerun()` call could cause infinite loops when processing messages.

**Fix**: By removing the rerun call, the app now processes messages naturally without forced restarts.

### 3. Session State Cleanup âœ…

**Problem**: Message processing could get stuck reprocessing the same input.

**Fix**: The app now processes user input once and continues naturally without requiring manual page refreshes.

## Technical Changes

### File Modified

- `src/language_tutor/ui/streamlit_app.py`

### Changes Made

1. **Removed `st.rerun()` call** from message processing logic (line ~457)
2. **Fixed formatting** issues caused by the removal

### Remaining Work

- There is still 1 `st.rerun()` call in the voice input section, but this is less critical and doesn't affect the main flow
- Voice input functionality should work better now, but may still require some refinement

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### âœ… What Should Work Now

- **Single-click start**: Practice sessions should start with one click
- **Immediate response**: First user message should be processed right away
- **No hanging**: App should not get stuck or require page refreshes
- **Stable operation**: No infinite loops or crashes during normal use

### ðŸ§ª How to Test

1. Go to Practice Mode tab
2. Enter a topic (e.g., "Ordering coffee")
3. Click "ðŸŽ¯ Start Practice Session" **once**
4. Type a message in French and press Enter
5. The AI should respond immediately without requiring additional clicks

## Voice Input Status

- Voice input (ðŸŽ¤ Record button) is available but may still have minor issues
- Speech-to-text functionality is implemented and should work
- Microphone testing (ðŸ”§ Test Mic) should work properly

## Code Quality

- No syntax errors
- App starts and runs successfully
- All services properly initialized
- STT (Speech-to-Text) integration maintained
